ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Clara -- @claraweber -- a medical student gone astray in biomedical imaging of the human brain, computer science, and web development. Mostly somewhere between Yale, MNI, LÃ¼beck University, and Berlin. 

I work with Python, R, javascript/HTML and am a newbie in Matlab. 
Shoot me a message! ðŸš€
